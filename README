Watercress
==========

Watercress is a tool to generate a styleguide based on comments within a CSS file. Inspired by KSS, but designed with further automation in mind. Written in Scala with a hint of Java.

Watercress is currently in development. Examples will be forthcoming, pending a stable release.
